### Vite, React, Redux Template

# This is a template library for building blazing fast applications with Vite, React, and Redux.

# Routing

The app uses react-router for routing. The routing component is found in `src/Components/Router.tsx`, this repo will eventually be updated to support authenticated routes in the near future.

# Redux

The app support Redux `createApi` for all of the state management. All of the Redux data is stored in `src/Data/Redux` and the store provider can be found in `src/Components/ContextProvider.tsx`

# Vite

I make use of Vite's blazing fast development environment. Most settings are left alone and can be found in the normal Vite app locations.
